## Setting up a local or production cluster from scratch

The instructions in this section will cover setting up a local (developer)
cluster as well as a production cluster pipeline in CentOS CI. If you
have access to an existing deployment and just want to set up a parallel
"developer pipeline" skip ahead to the [Running A Developer Pipeline Alongside an Existing Deployment](#running-a-developer-pipeline-alongside-an-existing-deployment)
section.

As for setting up a new pipeline, one key piece of information is that
the `manifests/pipeline.yaml` file contains an OpenShift template that
will set up a Jenkins pipeline using the
[Kubernetes Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin).
The instructions below will help you deploy the pipeline. A section header
may indicate that the section only applies to one of the two workflows.

### [LOCAL] Set up an OpenShift cluster

First, make sure to install `oci-kvm-hook` on your host system (not in a
pet container). This is required to ensure that the pipeline has access
to `/dev/kvm`:

```
rpm-ostree install oci-kvm-hook # if on OSTree-based system
dnf install -y oci-kvm-hook # if on traditional
```

We will use `oc cluster up` to set up a local cluster for testing. To do
this, simply obtain the OpenShift v3.6.1 binary from
[here](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.6.1). We want
to match the OCP version running in CentOS CI.

`openshift-origin-client-tools` is enough for `oc cluster up`.

If you have not done so already, follow the instructions in the
[Prerequisites](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/v4.0.0-alpha.0/docs/cluster_up_down.md#prerequisites)
and [Getting Started](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/v4.0.0-alpha.0/docs/cluster_up_down.md#getting-started)
sections to set up your environment and start the Docker daemon.

If on Fedora > 28 and Openshift OKD < 3.11, the
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` unit file needs
overriding to use the `cgroupfs` cgroup driver instead
of `systemd`. (See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558425#c22
for more info). Add the override as follows:

```
systemctl edit --full docker.service
```

Change the following line (under `ExecStart`) from:

```
--exec-opt native.cgroupdriver=systemd \
```

to:

```
--exec-opt native.cgroupdriver=cgroupfs \
```

Restart the docker daemon for the override
to take effect:

```
systemctl restart docker.service
```

And now, bring up a v3.6.1 cluster (again, to match CentOS CI):

```
oc cluster up --version v3.6.1
```

To have persistent configs and data, I would recommend specifying the
dirs to use.

```
oc cluster up --version v3.6.1 \
    --host-config-dir=/srv/oc/config \
    --host-data-dir=/srv/oc/data \
    --host-pv-dir=/srv/oc/pv
```

Then when doing `oc cluster up` in the future, you can use
`--use-existing-config`:

```
oc cluster up --version v3.6.1 \
    --host-config-dir=/srv/oc/config \
    --host-data-dir=/srv/oc/data \
    --host-pv-dir=/srv/oc/pv \
    --use-existing-config
```

Once complete, something like the
following will show:

```
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://127.0.0.1:8443

You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: <any value>

To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin
```

Once the cluster is up, we need to mark our only node (`localhost`) as
oci-kvm-hook enabled. To do this:

```
oc login -u system:admin
oc patch node localhost -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"oci_kvm_hook":"allowed"}}}'
```

You can now sign in as as `developer`:

```
oc login -u developer https://127.0.0.1:8443
```

(Any password will work). The IP address to log in here may differ
according to the output from `oc cluster up`.

Ideally you will match the project name used for prod in CentOS CI
(`fedora-coreos`), but feel free to use a different project name
like `fedora-coreos-devel` if you'd like.

```
oc new-project fedora-coreos
```

And you're all set!

### [LOCAL] Fork the repo

If you're planning to test changes, it would be best to fork
this repo so that you do your work there. The workflow
requires a remote repo to which to push changes.

### Creating AWS credentials config

If you are in production where we upload builds to S3 OR you want to
test uploading to S3 as part of pipeline development you need to
create a credentials config as a secret within OpenShift.

First create a file with your secret content:

```
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/file
[default]
aws_access_key_id=keyid
aws_secret_access_key=key
EOF
```

Then create the secret in OpenShift:

```
oc create secret generic fcos-builds-bot-aws-config --from-file=config=/path/to/file
```

### Create a Jenkins instance with a persistent volume backing store

```
oc new-app --template=jenkins-persistent \
    --param=NAMESPACE=fedora-coreos \
    --param=MEMORY_LIMIT=2Gi \
    --param=VOLUME_CAPACITY=2Gi \
    --param=JENKINS_IMAGE_STREAM_TAG=jenkins:2
```

Notice the `NAMESPACE` parameter. This makes the Jenkins master use the
image from our namespace, which we'll create in the next step. (The
reason we create the app first is that otherwise OpenShift will
automatically instantiate Jenkins with default parameters when creating
the Jenkins pipeline).

The `jenkins:2` parameter is to match the tag name in the latest
OpenShift. Some older versions of the template in OpenShift uses
`jenkins:latest`. This will no longer be needed once we are running on a
newer version of OpenShift than 3.6 in
CentOS CI. See [#32](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-pipeline/pull/32)
and [#70](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-pipeline/pull/70)
for more context).

### Create the pipeline from the template

If working on the production pipeline, you may simply do:

```
oc new-app --file=manifests/pipeline.yaml
```

If working on a local cluster you will want to override the defaults
for some parameters:

- `DEVELOPER_PREFIX` - **REQUIRED**
    - The prefix to prepend to created resources.
    - This is recommended to be your username followed by a dash.
      i.e. `jlebon-`. The pipeline will simply not run without a
      `DEVELOPER_PREFIX` set if it is not running in prod mode.
- `PIPELINE_REPO_URL`
    - Git source URI for pipeline Jenkinsfile
- `PIPELINE_REPO_REF`
    - Git branch/tag reference for pipeline Jenkinsfile
- `PIPELINE_FCOS_CONFIG_URL`
    - Git source URI for FCOS config
- `PIPELINE_FCOS_CONFIG_REF`
    - Git branch/tag reference for FCOS config
- `PVC_SIZE`
    - Size of the PVC to create
- `COREOS_ASSEMBLER_IMAGE`
    - Image of coreos-assembler to use
- `S3_BUCKET`
    - AWS S3 bucket in which to store builds (or blank for none)


```
oc new-app --file=manifests/pipeline.yaml \
    --param=DEVELOPER_PREFIX=$(whoami)- \
    --param=PIPELINE_REPO_URL=https://github.com/jlebon/fedora-coreos-pipeline \
    --param=PIPELINE_REPO_REF=my-feature-branch \
    --param=S3_BUCKET=jlebon-fcos \
    --param=PVC_SIZE=20Gi
```

This template creates:

1. the Jenkins master imagestream,
2. the Jenkins slave imagestream,
3. the coreos-assembler imagestream,
4. the `PersistentVolumeClaim` in which we'll cache, and
5. the Jenkins pipeline build.

The default size of the PVC is 100Gi. There is a `PVC_SIZE`
parameter one can use to make this smaller if you do not
have enough space. E.g. `--param=PVC_SIZE=30Gi`.

We can now start a build of the Jenkins master:

```
oc start-build --follow fedora-coreos-jenkins
```

Once the Jenkins master image is built, Jenkins should start up (verify
with `oc get pods`). Once the pod is marked READY, you should be able to
login to the Jenkins UI at https://jenkins-fedora-coreos.$CLUSTER_URL/
(`oc get route jenkins` will show the URL). As previously noted, any
password works to log in as `developer`.

It may be a good idea to set the Kubernetes plugin to
[use DNS for service names](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#issue-for-jenkins-dns-names).

### Start build using the CLI

Once Jenkins is ready, the Fedora CoreOS pipeline should've already been
started. You can verify this by checking the job in the web UI, or by
running `oc get builds`. You can also manually trigger a new build
using:

```
oc start-build fedora-coreos-pipeline
```

Use the web interface to view logs from builds.

### [PROD] Update the "secret" token value in the webhook to be unique

```
oc set triggers bc/fedora-coreos-pipeline-mechanical --from-webhook
```

### [PROD] Set up webhooks/automation

- From the GitHub Settings tab for `fedora-coreos-config`, go to the
  "Webhooks" panel
- Click "Add webhook"
- In the address, type `$JENKINS_URL/github-webhook/`. So e.g.:
  https://jenkins-fedora-coreos-devel.apps.ci.centos.org/github-webhook/
- Change the Content Type from GitHubâ€™s default `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `application/json`.
- Click "Add webhook"

Repeat these steps for the `fedora-coreos-pipeline` repo.

### [OPTIONAL] Set up simple-httpd

When hacking locally, it might be useful to look at the contents of the
PV to see the builds since one isn't rsync'ing to an artifact server.
One alternative to creating a "sleeper" pod with the PV mounted is to
expose a simple httpd server:

```
oc create -f manifests/simple-httpd.yaml
```

You'll then be able to browse the contents of the PV at:

```
http://simple-httpd-fedora-coreos.$CLUSTER_URL
```

(Or simply check the output of `oc get route simple-httpd`).

## Running A Developer Pipeline Alongside an Existing Deployment

If you already know of an existing deployed pipeline you can add some
namespaced (i.e. DEVELOPER_PREFIX) resources into the existing project
and run your own developer pipeline. This is useful if you simply want
to test a different COSA image or FCOS config or pipeline code, but
otherwise maintain the manifest the same.

### Running a Developer Pipeline Using the `devel-up` Script

The `devel-up` script will just add/edit/delete namespaced resources
within the project. For example, you can create/update resources for
yourself using something like:


```
./devel-up --update \
        --pipeline https://github.com/jlebon/fedora-coreos-pipeline     \
        --config https://github.com/jlebon/fedora-coreos-config@feature \
        --cosa-img quay.io/jlebon/coreos-assembler:random-tag           \
        --bucket jlebon-fcos
```

You can provide `--prefix` to `devel-up` but if you don't it will
default to your local username.

Any value you don't pass to devel-up will be reset to its default
value from the `manifests/pipeline.yaml` OpenShift template. This is
currently as designed (see [#65](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-pipeline/issues/65)).

To tear down the developer pipeline run `./devel-up --delete`.
