# This file controls the plugins that get installed in Jenkins
# To get a list of these from a running jenkins instance go to
# <jenkins_url>/pluginManager/api/json?depth=1 in your web browser
# (with authentication) then save that json output and filter it
# with:
#
# cat json.json \
#   | jq -r '.plugins[] | "\(.shortName):\(.version)"' | sort > plugins.txt

# The plugins we list here are in addition to the ones that are
# delivered with the jenkins image delivered by OpenShift, which
# are defined here [1] in bundle-plugins.txt. That list is a depsovled
# version of the base-plugins.txt [2]. The relationship between these
# two files is described here [3]. Note that the plugins/versions that
# get pulled in OpenShift is from an OpenShift release and might not
# be up to date with what is in the master branch. You'll have to
# look at the release branch for the release of OpenShift you are on.

# The below list are plugins that are also in base-plugins.txt but for
# some reason or other we need to temporarily freeze or fast-track.
#
# NOTE: 20221004 had to fast-track token-macro to 293.v283932a_0a_b_49
# because the old version was preventing another plugin from starting. I
# imagine this most recent change upstream [1] hasn't landed in an OpenShift
# release yet.

# NOTE: 20221004 had to fast-track kubernetes plugin (from bundle-plugins.txt)
# to 1.31.2 because of https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67483. 1.31.2 is
# still 6+ months out of date. jlebon filed https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/issues/1493
# to try to get the team to use a newer version.
