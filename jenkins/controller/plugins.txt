# This file controls the plugins that get installed in Jenkins
# To get a list of these from a running jenkins instance go to
# <jenkins_url>/pluginManager/api/json?depth=1 in your web browser
# (with authentication) then save that json output and filter it
# with:
#
# cat json.json \
#   | jq -r '.plugins[] | "\(.shortName):\(.version)"' | sort > plugins.txt
#
# Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/52836951


# The plugins we list here are in addition to the ones that are
# delivered with the jenkins image delivered by OpenShift, which
# are defined here [1] in bundle-plugins.txt. That list is a depsolved
# version of the base-plugins.txt [2]. The relationship between these
# two files is described here [3]. Note that the plugins/versions that
# get pulled in OpenShift is from an OpenShift release and might not
# be up to date with what is in the master branch. You'll have to
# look at the release branch for the release of OpenShift you are on.
